CODEAWAKE BRIEFING (Local Analysis)

PROJECT TYPE:     Python project
MAIN PURPOSE:     Web service (Flask detected)
ENTRY POINT:      Not detected

HOW TO RUN:       pip install -r requirements.txt && python main.py

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
CORE FILES (likely important):

  flaskr/blog.py            Important source file
  flaskr/auth.py            Important source file
  tests/test_blog.py        Important source file

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
SAFE TO EDIT (low risk):

  static/
  tests/

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
⚠️  RISKY FILES (edit carefully):

  auth/                     Security-critical code

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
DATA FLOW (estimated):

  Check entry point and follow imports to understand flow

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
WHERE TO START:

  1. Find the entry point (check package.json or main file)
  2. Look at folder structure to understand organization
  3. Check configuration files for environment setup
  4. Start with safe areas (components, styles) for small changes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
💡 This is a quick structural analysis.
   For a full senior-engineer briefing, set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY:

**What this demonstrates:**
- Detected Flask framework (Web service)
- Identified flaskr/blog.py, flaskr/auth.py as core files
- Found static/ and tests/ as safe areas
- Correctly flagged auth/ as security-critical
