Target: r/programming

I kept opening repos and spending an hour figuring out where to start, especially with AI-generated code, so I built a CLI that briefs the project before you touch anything.

Run it in any directory and it prints a structured orientation: project type, entry point, core files, safe vs risky areas, and a rough data flow. Works without an API key (local heuristics) or with one for deeper analysis.

Example output:

```
PROJECT TYPE:     Node.js project
MAIN PURPOSE:     Web application (Next.js detected)
ENTRY POINT:      app/page.tsx

HOW TO RUN:       npm install && npm start

CORE FILES (start here):
  app/page.tsx              Main entry point
  lib/utils.ts              Important source file

SAFE TO EDIT:     components/, fonts/
RISKY:            config/, package.json
```
